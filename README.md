Creating a website and Chrome add-on to automatically analyse the quality and veracity of science and health news.

Website will allow url of science and health articles and will then provide analysis. The tool will scrape the article page to identify research paper on which the article is based. 
Will have search function to find original research paper and will use Claude via API to assess how accurately the article represented the information in the research paper. 
In the event that no research paper can be found, analysis will still be provided with general science/health knowledge.

Mostly vibecoding.
